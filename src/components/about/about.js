      <p>
        I am a furniture designer and woodworker based in Vancouver, British
        Columbia, Canada. My work is modern but grounded in centuries of
        woodworking traditions and hand tool techniques. It is built to live
        harmoniously alongside a wide range of furniture styles, and last many
        lifetimes of daily use.

      <p>I am currently unavailable for commission work.</p>
